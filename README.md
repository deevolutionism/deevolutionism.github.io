## [EthGlobal Hackathon 2021](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/ethonline2021/citizen-dao)

![CDAO](/cdao.png)

Worked with a multidiciplinary team of entreprenuers, hackers and designers to prototype a DApp for coordinating, funding, and solving humanities biggest challenges in the broad categories of Health, Housing, Education, Climate, Finance, and Governance during the [EthGlobal 2021 Hackathon](https://online.ethglobal.com/).

[CitizenDAO Hackathon Submission](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/ethonline2021/citizen-dao)

We're in the process of bootstrapping the DAO by selling Social Impact NFT bonds that will: 

- Raise funds for the treasury
- distribute CDAO tokens, used for community, governance and coordination
- raise awareness
- retrospectively fund active projects in the supported categories
- proactively fund new projects

The basic structure we proposed looks a bit like this: 

Projects can be proposed using the [discource](https://ideas.citizendao.com/)

CDAO Bonds are issued during what we call seasons and sold to the community to raise funding / awareness for projects

The CDAO tokens are then used to vote on which projects should be rewarded during the season using snapshot.

Tokens are distributed to projects that won the vote. A new season begins with a new cohort of projects (or old projects can try to win votes again)

The cycle continues.

We plan to continue development during the upcoming [fall 2021 chainlink hackathon](https://chain.link/hackathon)

As part of the 2021 [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/) hackathon I teamed up with a couple of my crypto friends to ideate on potential products that could utilize the amazing, intelligent network that is FWB. We came up with a product idea called Friends With Insights which basically would turn FWB into a collective intelligence service that can be called on by interested parties (companies, researchers, individuals, etc). FWB members could get early testing access to other products, provide feedback, and even collaborate. In return, companies that want to utilize FWB would have to buy and stake an amount of FWB tokens.

## [ASCAP](https://www.ascap.com/)

Worked on improving site reliability, accessibility, bug fixes, and implementing new features. Also helped ASCAP explore options for modernizing their frontend code base from backbone to Vue. Worked on prototype application that required reverse engineering their existing backbone code to Vue and developing a custom reusable component library based on their design system.

I have also worked on a handful of React apps for startups big and small

## [EINO](https://eino.ai/)

Developed their very first prototype data visualization dashboard for exploring cell tower usage and other related meta data accross several major cities, including NY and SF. The app was built with React, Redux, Sagas, Apex Charts, and Semantic UI. Also setup CI to an S3 bucket using bitbucket pipelines.

## Grapple Media

Developed the second iteration of their UI which included important core features such as search, filtering, and a multi-panel layout similar to Tweet Deck that allowed users to easily keep track of important streams of information.

## WeWork

Helped design and develop a prototype meeting rooms booking kiosk app to give WeWork members an alternative option for quickly and conveniently booking the nearest available room. Built with React, interfacing with the WeWork meeting room API service.
