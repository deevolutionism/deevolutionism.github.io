I have also worked on a handful of React apps for startups big and small

### EINO

Developed their very first prototype data visualization dashboard for exploring cell tower usage and other related meta data accross several major cities, including NY and SF. The app was built with React, Redux, Sagas, Apex Charts, and Semantic UI. Also setup CI to an S3 bucket using bitbucket pipelines.

### Grapple Media

Developed the second iteration of their UI which included important core features such as search, filtering, and a multi-panel layout similar to Tweet Deck that allowed users to easily keep track of important streams of information.

### WeWork

Helped design and develop a prototype meeting rooms booking kiosk app to give WeWork members an alternative option for quickly and conveniently booking the nearest available room. Built with React, interfacing with the WeWork meeting room API service.
