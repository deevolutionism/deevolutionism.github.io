## CitizenDAO Impact Protocol

### NFT social impact marketplace concept for funding project development
---
As part of my web3 exploration journey, I decided joining a hackathon would be a good environment to get down and dirty. My objective was to learn some basic tools and fundamental concepts for interacting with a blockchain as well as explore the solution space. Since the launch of [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) on Ethereum back in 2018 and an initial surge of excitement generated by[cyrptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), then Cryptopunks and more recently BAYC, I wondered could there be more to NFTs than just PFPs (which earily reminded me of the beanie baby craze)? Loot box items and in game content seems like a natural and obvious use case for NFTs. But what about real world impact (not to say gaming doesn't have any real world impact, but it is slightly disconected from reality... tho the gap is closing on a daily basis.)

Enter: EthGlobal Hackathon. Stumbling across this event, which was being promoted by Austin Griffith - a dev I was following on Twitter, seemed like a good oportunity to learn a thing or 2 and also get a feel for the community. The hackathon took place in a virtual format, and as the name implies: it was open to global participation. The whole thing is orchestrated through Discord (very on-theme for crypto)
